# BankApi

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).

## Once the server is up and running 

Send this request - 

* API: http://localhost:4000/api/connect
* body:
  {
      "username": "black_smudge",
      "password": "capeverde"
  }

You should be able to see all the data in your terminal!


Thank you so much for such an amazing challenge. I had a great time learning the system!
I must say it was quiet challenging to figure out the correct tokens. The uncertainty made me curious and the outcomes were like a reward!

I enjoyed learning Elixir, but feel the need to learn further!
I believe I could have implemented a better api system, Hopefully you would give me a chance to learn further and do so!

Thank you so much for a great challenge, Looking forward to hearing from you!
